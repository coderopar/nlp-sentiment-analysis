# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on text data.  
It identifies whether a piece of text expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.  

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook (`sentiment_analysis.ipynb`).

---

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
- Sentiment classification using machine learning / deep learning models.
- Visualization of results (charts and word clouds).
- Example predictions on sample text.

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```

### Example
Inside the notebook, you can run:
```python
sample_text = "I love this product!"
predict_sentiment(sample_text)
```
Expected output:
```
Positive
```

## Requirements
The main Python libraries used include:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `nltk` (for natural language processing)

*(Exact versions should be listed in `requirements.txt` if available.)*

└── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies (to be created)
```

---

## Results
- Model can classify text as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
- Visualization plots show distribution of sentiments.
- Word clouds highlight frequent positive/negative terms.

*(See notebook for detailed results.)*

## Next Steps / Improvements
- Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, BERT).
- Expand dataset for better accuracy.
- Deploy as a web app or API for real-world use.
